# CST369PigGame
A Pig dice game made for Android. I did this while in CST 369 (Smartphone App Development) at Roosevelt University. I need
to fix when the computer takes it turn. Was intially just trying to sleep a thread for 2000ms for each computer turn but didn't
like how it worked. This was my 3rd app done in Android.

The game is basically you roll 2 dice, if you roll snake eyes (two 1's) you lose all points and turn is shifted to other player.
If you roll one 1 then you lose that rounds points and turn is shifted to other player. If you don't roll any ones you add it to
your current round score and can keep rolling or pass turn and add the trough to total.
